**About the website**

E-commerce website with fully integrated payment system - Stripe.

 Users can add items to the cart, remove items from the cart and change quantity.

 After user clicks on Pay with Stripe, site redirects automatically to Stripe platform where it asks for payment method, shipping address etc.

 Once user fills all required fields and clicks Pay, system redirects to Success page if payment is completed. Stripe does not charge users card since its in a test mode and its recommended to use fake card number and other information.
